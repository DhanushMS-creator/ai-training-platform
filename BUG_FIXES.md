# Bug Fixes - October 16, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Score Shows "1/10" Instead of "1/5"

**Problem:** Backend was generating 10 questions instead of 5.

**Root Cause:** Old questions were already generated with 10 questions before the code change.

**Solution:**

- Deleted all existing MCQ questions from database
- Backend already updated to default to 5 questions
- Next session will generate only 5 questions

**Files Modified:**

- Backend database (cleared old questions)

---

### 2. âœ… "Your training assistant is speaking" Instead of "Laura is speaking"

**Problem:** Greeting page showed generic text instead of Laura's name.

**Solution:**

- Updated `AvatarGreeting.tsx` to show "Laura is speaking..." instead of "Your training assistant is speaking..."

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/AvatarGreeting/AvatarGreeting.tsx`

**Change:**

```tsx
// Before
<p>ðŸŽ¤ Your training assistant is speaking...</p>

// After
<p>ðŸŽ¤ Laura is speaking...</p>
```

---

### 3. âœ… Show Correct Answer When User is Wrong

**Problem:** When user selected wrong answer, it only showed "Incorrect" without showing which option was correct.

**Solution:**

- Modified backend `submit_answer` API to include `correct_answer` in response
- Updated `Question.tsx` component to accept and display correct answer
- Added visual highlighting for correct answer when user is wrong
- Added "Correct Answer" badge on the correct option

**Files Modified:**

- `backend/apps/assessments/views.py` - Added `correct_answer` to API response
- `frontend/src/components/MCQFlow/Question.tsx` - Added `correctAnswer` prop and visual indicators
- `frontend/src/components/MCQFlow/MCQFlow.tsx` - Pass correct answer from API response to Question component
- `frontend/src/components/MCQFlow/MCQFlow.css` - Added styling for correct answer highlight

**Visual Improvements:**

- Selected wrong answer: Shows in RED with âœ— icon
- Correct answer: Shows in LIGHT GREEN with "Correct Answer" badge
- Smooth animation when highlighting correct answer
