---

## 🎬 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

### Step 1: Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# 1. Run the setup script
setup.bat

# 2. Start backend (Terminal 1)
start-backend.bat

# 3. Start frontend (Terminal 2)
start-frontend.bat
```

### Step 2: Test Backend API

1. **Access Django Admin**: http://localhost:8000/admin

   - Log in with superuser credentials
   - Verify models are created

2. **Test Registration API**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/register/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"name\":\"Test User\",\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"job_title\":\"Developer\",\"industry\":\"Tech\"}"
   ```

3. **Test MCQ Generation** (you need to provide a PDF):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/sessions/1/generate/ \
     -F "pdf_file=@your_training_material.pdf" \
     -F "num_questions=10"
   ```

### Step 3: Test Frontend Registration

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Submit and verify:
   - Success message
   - sessionId stored in localStorage
   - Navigation attempted (will fail until greeting component is built)

### Step 4: Build Remaining Components

#### Option A: I Can Help You Build Them

Tell me:

1. **Training video URL** - What video should be embedded?
2. **PDF document** - Upload or describe the training material
3. **Any specific styling preferences** for the components

#### Option B: Follow the Implementation Guide

- See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed component specifications
- Use the API service (`services/api.ts`) - all functions are ready
- Reference the LiveKit agent code for avatar integration

## 📋 Information Needed From You

### 1. Training Video URL 🎥

**Question**: What is the URL of the training video to be embedded?

- YouTube URL?
- Vimeo URL?
- Direct MP4 URL?
- Embedded iframe code?

**Example**:

```
https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID
or
https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEO_ID
or
https://example.com/video.mp4
```

### 2. Training Material PDF 📄

**Question**: Do you have the PDF document ready?

- What is the content about?
- How many pages?
- Can you share it so I can test MCQ generation?

**Note**: The system will:

- Extract text from the PDF
- Combine it with trainee's job title & industry
- Use Gemini to generate relevant questions

### 3. Avatar Behavior 🤖

**Question**: What should the avatar say in each stage?

**Greeting**:

- Generic: "Hello {name}, welcome to your training!"
- Specific: Custom script based on industry?

**Video Navigation**:

- "Great! Now let's watch the training video."
- "Please watch the following video carefully."

**MCQ Navigation**:

- "You've completed the video. Ready for the assessment?"
- "Let's test your knowledge with some questions."

### 4. Deployment Plans 🚀

**Question**: Where will this be deployed?

- Local network only?
- Cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, Heroku)?
- Need production database setup?
